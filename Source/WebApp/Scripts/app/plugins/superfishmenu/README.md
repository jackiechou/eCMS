# jQuery Superfish Dropdown Menu Plugin

Our favourite aquatic superhero returns from his sojourn across the galaxy infused with astonishing, hitherto unseen new powers. In his modern incarnation (wearing a rather spiffy cape) Superfish is dedicated to keeping dropdown/flyout menus accessible across browsers great and small, in addition to adding support for newer touch devices (running Android, iOS, Windows, etc). All this **and** a pretty face.

## Documentation and Demos

Please use the [existing Superfish documentation](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/) where you will find full explanations of the customisable features and plenty of examples to get you started.

## Download

**Important note:** As of Superfish v1.5.1 if you wish to enhance your menu with Brian Cherne's hoverIntent plugin (highly recommended) you will need to use a [patched version that supports event delegation](https://github.com/joeldbirch/onHoverIntent).

## Recently added features

- Full support for touch devices. Great for mobile-first web design. Add some CSS media queries and use the same menu code-base at all screen sizes.
- Submenu closing animations. Customisable separately to opening animations.
- Optionally `useClick` instead of mouse hovers to open and close menus. This is separate to the touch support, which always requires a tap to open submenus.
